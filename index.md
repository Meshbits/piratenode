### About this project

The purpose of this website is to be a placeholder for easy to access guides and tutorials for setting up a personal pirate chain full node at home.
The tutorials and guides on this website may not be perfect, but could give you some ideas and starting point to get started with how to achive it.

### Why this project exists

In true Bitcoin's nature, the author(s)/contributor(s) of this website beleives there must be resources made available for people to allow them to build and manage personal full node of Pirate Chain blockchain. Every day we witness another news hitting central point in cryptocurrency industry which gets hit by the centralised authorities, resulting in taken down of the services which played important role in cryptocurrency space. This project just tries to help build more peer nodes on the network which are controled and operated by regular users with low and minimal efforts possible, and in much efficient resources, resulting to help stronger decentralisation in Pirate Chain network.
